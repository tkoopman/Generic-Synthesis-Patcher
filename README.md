## [SynthOutfits](SynthOutfits.md)

This can create new LeveledItem and Outfit records, and assign them to NPC's Default or Sleeping outfits, and/or add to Spell Perk Item Distributor (SPID) file.  
SynthOutfits keeps track of IDs assigned in previous runs to make sure the same FormKey is used each time, even if you add/remove configurations.
