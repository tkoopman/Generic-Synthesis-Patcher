                        Matching priority will be applied in random order so be careful if multiple rules edit the same field on a record.

                        List valid record types for this rule. Types are case insensitive. You can see list of implemented types <a href="./fields.html">here</a>.<br />
                        You can either enter the full type name excluding spaces, or the alias. So "WordOfPower" is the same as "WOOP".

                <div class="setting">
                    <div class="label">Masters:</div>
                    <div>
                        List of mod names ("Skyrim.esm"). Original record must come from one of these master mods to match.<br />
                        To change to a list of masters to exclude, use "!Masters" instead.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="setting">
                    <div class="label">PatchedBy:</div>
                    <div>
                        List of mod names ("unofficial skyrim special edition patch.esp"). By default this is an OR check, so record must of been patched by one or more of these mods to match.<br />

                        Replace "PatchedBy" with:
                        <ul>
                            <li>"!PatchedBy": Exclude if matched by any listed mod.</li>
                            <li>"^PatchedBy": XOR. Be patched by exactly one of the listed mods.</li>
                            <li>
                                "&PatchedBy": Change to AND check, so to match record, it must match all listed mods. When using AND each listed mod can be prefixed:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>"!unofficial skyrim special edition patch.esp": to mean mod must not of been patched by this mod.</li>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        NOTE: PatchedBy will not match records that originate from a mod, only if patched by. Use Masters for that.
                        So if listing in the same rule, the same single mod in both Masters and PatchedBy no records will ever match.

                    <div>
                        null (default), true or false. Checked if a previous rule has already applied a patch to this record.<br />
                        Using "Patched": false will mean this rule will only match if the record hasn't already been patched by another rule.<br />
                        Omit this or set to null to ignore patched state.<br />
                        Note: This doesn't care what field has been patched, just that a patch record has been created.

                <h3>Rule Only Filters</h3>

                <div class="setting">
                    <div class="label">EditorID:</div>
                    <div>
                        EditorID(s) to match. Can be a regular expression if starts and ends with /. Example "EditorID": "/.\*fur.\*/"<br />
                        To change to a list of EditorID(s) to exclude, use "!EditorID" instead.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="setting">
                    <div class="label">FormID:</div>
                    <div>
                        FormID(s) to match in the format "0123AB:Skyrim.esm". Can exclude leading 0s.<br />
                        To change to a list of FormID(s) to exclude, use "!FormID" instead.
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="setting">
                    <div class="label">OnlyIfDefault:</div>
                    <div>
                        False by default. If set to True will only apply action if the winning record's field value matches the original value set by the master record.<br />
                        Good for example if you want to forward one patches changes, but only if a later patch set the value back to the default, so protecting other winning patches.<br />
                        Checks are per field, meaning one action may fail to apply due to the field it updating not matching, but other action on the same record applies as it does match.<br />
                        <strong>NOTE</strong>: Just because multiple fields are listed on a single fill/forward action, they are all still processed separately. No need to split into different rules.

                </div>

                <h3>Rule Only - Field Matches</h3>

                Using Matches you can filter on any <a href="./fields.html">supported field</a>.<br />
                In general they follow the following rules:
                <ul>
                    <li>If you use one of these filters, any record that doesn't contain that field will never match the rule.</li>
                    <li>
                        If field is single value, like Name then:
                        <ul>
                            <li>+/!: You can add a prefix to these to say if they must be included or excluded from filter, however all entries should be the same prefix.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If field is list of multiple values, like Keywords then:
                        <ul>
                            <li>&/|/^ Operator: You can change the default operation using a prefix on the field name. Default is OR (|). Can set to And (&) or XOR (^).</li>
                            <li>+/!: You can add a prefix to these to say if they must be included or excluded from filter. If using AND (&) each can be different prefix.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Include (+) and OR (|) prefixes are default so no need to enter them however, can be used for unforeseen cases where the value you want to enter may start with a prefix value. Like trying to enter a negative number ("+-123" to allowed -123).</li>
                    <li>If matching against a field that accepts a string or Editor ID you can use regular expression to match, like EditorID filter. If used with exclude operator the ! goes before the first /, like in the 4th example below.</li>
                    <li>- is same as ! prefix</li>
                    <li>Just like other filters if you list multiple different fields, the record must match all.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Examples</h4>
                Single Value Match - Matches any record when keywords assigned to record contains this keyword.
                <pre>"Matches": { "Keywords": "ArmorMaterialLeather" }</pre>
                AND Match with exclude Example, so must contain all included keywords, but none of the excluded keywords.
                <pre>"Matches": { "&Keywords": [ "ArmorMaterialLeather", "ArmorMaterialHide", "!WAF_ClothingCloak" ] }</pre>
                OR Not Match Example. Will match any record that doesn't contain any of these keywords.
                <pre>"Matches": { "Keywords": [ "!ArmorMaterialLeather", "!ArmorMaterialHide" ] }</pre>

                Exclude Regex Example - Will match any record where EditorID of the assigned InventoryArt, doesn't match the Regex.
                <pre>"Matches": { "InventoryArt": "!/^(?!.*(?:(?:Book)|(?:Journal)|(?:Tome))).*((?:Note)|(?:Scroll)|(?:Paper)|(?:Map)|(?:Recipe)).*$/" }</pre>

                At least 1 action should exist, under most circumstances (see <a href="#group">SingleMatch Groups</a> below), else what's the point of the rule. If multiple provided then multiple actions the processing order will be:
                <ul>
                    <li>Merge</li>
                    <li>Forward - Should be self only if also using merge, else will overwrite merge.</li>
                    <li>Fill - Could be used to add / remove extra stuff post Merge/Forward.</li>

                        If single value field, then will just overwrite field with what you put in fill action.<br />
                        If field selected is a <font color="label">list</font> then:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Fill will add / remove items from the list, based on prefix of the item.</li>

                        By default this is just a straight replace including if it is a list field like Items. It doesn't do any merging.<br />

                    <div>
                        ForwardOptions can change how Forward actions work. Multiple options can be combined. Following are the valid options:
                        <div class="setting">
                            <div class="label">Default</div>
                            <div>Will replace winning with value from forwarding mod as described above.</div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="setting">
                            <div class="label">SelfMasterOnly</div>
                            <div>
                                This is only relevant when forwarding changes from lists of FormIDs. This includes Keywords.<br />
                                It will only add new FormIDs to lists if FormID is from the same mod that you are forwarding from.<br />
                                It will not remove any current items from winning records. If however it is combined with the Default option, then the first mod in the list will perform the Default forward, while all other listed mods will perform SelfMasterOnly.<br />
                                Below example would make sure any cloaks that "Cloaks - Dawnguard.esp" added to outfits would be added to winning records if it was removed by another patch.<br />
                                However the couple of changes it makes like adding back "Vampire Boots" [00B5DE:Dawnguard.esm] that the original Cloaks.esp removed would not be forwarded.<br />
                                <pre>

                            <div>
                                This changes how the contents of the Forward action is defined.<br />
                                By default, it is "Mod.esp" : ["field1", ...].<br />
                                Setting this to true changes it to "field":["Mod1.esp", "Mod2.esp", ....].<br />
                                Depending on what you are doing one or the other may be more efficient for you to read. Inside the patcher both produce the same result.<br />
                                If used with ForwardOption of Default, as only a single mods value would be copied over it will pick the first mod from the list that contains this record.<br />
                                Below example will forward record from PrvtI_HeavyArmory.esp unless it doesn't contain the record in which case Immersive Weapons.esp will be tried.<br />

                                This one is complex for me to explain in full. Firstly had troubles coming up with name so for now it is Highest Priority Unique (HPU).<br />
                                This could be seen as the "Merge" for non list fields, and on that HPU is invalid on list fields that implement the Merge action.<br />
                                Basically HPU will look at all values a record's field has had across all mods, and find the highest priority unique value. However it does respect defined Masters of mods.<br />
                                So if a patch mod has defined Master(s) then patch record's value will still be used for those defined master(s) even if setting it back to previous value.<br />
                                This is mainly for record types that are often validly included in mods but not changed like Worldspace and Cell records.<br />

                                If used with <font class="good">Sort</font>, then mod order is sorted into a random order once and that order applied to all records for this field. Normal picking of which mod to use from the random order still applies.<br />
                                Without <font class="bad">Sort</font> then a random mod will be picked per record. If you have multiple forward fields with same list of mods, each field does random independently.<br />

                                The first mod listed for a field will use the Default method. All others will follow using the SelfMasterOnly method.<br />
                                NOTE: The first mod must contain the record and if OnlyIfDefault set, pass that check, else it will not apply any of the SelfMasterOnly forwards.<br />
                                All other mods do not check OnlyIfDefault, and can fail to find matching record without stopping the processing of other mods.

                        This is like Bashing but with a lot more control, as you cannot only merge just the fields you want, but use filters to only merge the records you want.<br />
                        You also can tell the merge to exclude a plug-in or force the values of a plug-in to not be removed. Please see <a href="https://github.com/tkoopman/Generic-Synthesis-Patcher/blob/master/Examples/Merges%20Template.json" target="_blank">Merge Example.json</a>

                <h1>Groups</h1>

                Groups allow you to group multiple rules together. This can assist in making the JSON files easier to maintain, but also opens up performance improvements, and some special processing.<br />
                You <strong>can not</strong> have groups within groups. Rules in groups are processed in order the are in the JSON file. This means the Priority field for Rules in a group is ignored.

                <h2>Group Properties</h2>

                <div class="setting">
                    <div class="label">SingleMatch</div>
                    <div>
                        True or False (Default). If true a record will stop trying to match rules once it finds it's first match.<br />
                        When this is true, it is the one time having a rule with no actions does something. That something is stop any records that match the rule from progressing to further rules in the group.

                </div>

                Example - Both rules in this group must be Factions in Skyrim.esm, it will also stop search for rules once it find a match for a record.<br />
                SingleMatch not necessary in this example, as only a single rule would match anyway, but still saves processing time by having it.

                <h2>Debug / Trace Logging</h2>

                If you have set your logging level to Debug or Trace in the settings page of GSP in Synthesis, you can use the following to enable logs to be generated for select rules.<br />
                If used on a group it will only enable the Debug/Trace logging for the filters defined on the group. So you can add to both the group and/or rules in that group to get the logs you want.

                    </div>
                </div>

                Remember logging must be set to either Debug or Trace in Synthesis GSP plug-in settings for this to have any effect.<br />
                Debug in general will output extra logs about what the patcher has done.<br />
                Trace will include all debug logs but also a lot extra, like why the patcher may not of done something (Failed to match rule, Value already matched what you tried to set).<br />

                You should always include Trace logs if reporting bugs, but as they are big:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Limit what is logged by either:
                        <ul>
                            <li>using FormKey filter on settings page of GSP in Synthesis to limit to logging a single record that is affected by bug,</li>
                            <li>or if FormKey not available the above Debug filter to only output logs for rule relevant to bug.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Then either attach as text file to GitHub issue,<br />
                        or if you using Nexus you <strong>must</strong> use spoiler tags.
