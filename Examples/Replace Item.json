/*
  Replaces an item with another.
  Only gotcha is Matches and Removing items in Fill action do not check Lvl or Qty, so will be replaced all regardless with what ever you fill.
  So in this example every Iron Sword will be replaced with 1 Wooden Sword regardless of the Qty of Iron Swords.
  You can still add count to fill on the Wooden Sword but would still replace all with whatever Qty you specify.
